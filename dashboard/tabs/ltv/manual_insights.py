# Revenue Segmentation insights
REVENUE_SEGMENTATION_INSIGHTS = """
Revenue based user segmentation reveals distinct user groups with varying monetization behaviors.

E.g.: Whale segment (despite small user base of 1% of total activeusers) contributes  ~ 75% majority of revenue

LTV therefore varies significantly across segments.

To capture this, recommend using segment-specific LTV metrics for more accurate user valuation and targeted marketing strategies.
"""

# Retention Rate insights
RETENTION_RATE_INSIGHTS = """
LTV also depends heavily on user retention patterns.

Historical retention data of 3 weeks after install shows a steep drop-off in user retention within the first 7 days, followed by a more gradual decline thereafter.

Weibull model on retention data shows after 90 days of install, only ~0.03% of users remain active.
