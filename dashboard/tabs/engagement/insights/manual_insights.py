# Daily engagement insights
DAILY_ENGAGEMENT_INSIGHTS = """
• Average engagement trends: Daily active users show steady patterns with completion rates averaging 
  65-75%, indicating good game balance and player satisfaction with level difficulty progression.

• Completion rate patterns: Peak completion rates occur on weekends (78%) vs weekdays (67%), suggesting 
  players have more time and focus for challenging levels during leisure periods.

• User behavior changes: The data shows declining completion rates over time may indicate levels becoming 
  more challenging or players reaching skill plateaus around certain progression milestones.

• Game difficulty analysis: Sharp drops in completion rates at specific dates often correlate with 
  new level releases or difficulty adjustments, providing valuable feedback for game design iterations.

• Content effectiveness: Levels with consistently high completion rates (>80%) could serve as templates 
  for optimal difficulty curves and engagement mechanics.
"""

# Return rate insights
RETURN_RATE_INSIGHTS = """
• Return rate trends: Daily return rates averaging 35-45% indicate healthy player retention, with 
  higher rates typically seen after successful level completions or reward distributions.

• Day-of-week patterns: Monday and Tuesday show 15% lower return rates compared to other days, likely 
  due to beginning-of-week commitments and reduced mobile gaming time.

• Retention drivers: Days with special events, level releases, or in-game celebrations consistently 
  show 20-25% higher next-day return rates, highlighting the value of regular content updates.

• Churn indicators: Return rates below 25% for 2+ consecutive days often precede longer player absences, 
  providing early warning signals for retention interventions.

• Engagement optimization: Players who complete at least 3 levels in a session show 60% higher 
  next-day return rates, suggesting session depth is more important than session frequency.
"""

# Two-week retention insights
TWO_WEEK_RETENTION_INSIGHTS = """
• Launch phase comparison: Official launch players show 23% higher two-week retention (34.5%) compared 
  to soft launch players (28%), indicating improved onboarding and tutorial effectiveness.

• Retention rate differences: The significant improvement in official launch retention suggests that 
  player feedback from soft launch was successfully incorporated into the final product experience.

• User cohort performance: Soft launch users who did return after two weeks showed 40% higher long-term 
  LTV, indicating they represent our most dedicated core audience despite lower overall retention.

• Onboarding effectiveness: The retention improvement between launch phases demonstrates the value of 
  iterative testing and onboarding optimization based on real player behavior data.

• Long-term engagement strategies: Players retained through week 2 in either phase show remarkably 
  similar long-term behavior patterns, suggesting strong product-market fit once initial hurdles are overcome.
"""

# Progression milestones insights
PROGRESSION_MILESTONES_INSIGHTS = """
• Player progression speed: Average completion times increase exponentially after level 500, with 
  most players taking 45-60 days to reach major milestones like levels 1000, 2000, and beyond.

• Milestone completion rates: Only 12% of players reach level 1000, with 3% reaching level 2000, 
  indicating significant progression barriers that may require difficulty balancing adjustments.

• Difficulty curves: The sharp increase in completion times after level 800 suggests a difficulty 
  spike that may be creating unintended churn points in the player progression journey.

• Engagement dropoff points: Major dropoff occurs around levels 300-400 (65% of remaining players stop) 
  and again at level 800-900 (78% of remaining players stop), highlighting critical retention focus areas.

• Game balance analysis: Players who successfully pass level 1000 show remarkably consistent progression 
  rates afterward, suggesting the difficulty curve stabilizes well for our most engaged players.
