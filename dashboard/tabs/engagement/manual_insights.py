Soft launch in Canada: 23.56% two-week retention (7,675 installs)

Official launch in the US: 8.57% two-week retention (21,391 installs)

Soft launch is scoped in a smaller, self-selected audience who actively seek out new games (early adopters), found the game through word-of-mouth or targeted channels for testing purposes.

Official launch is scoped in a broader audience with more casual players who may be less engaged or have higher churn rates.

As players get more experienced, they progress faster starting around level 800th
