# IAP Revenue insights
IAP_REVENUE_INSIGHTS = """
• Revenue concentration patterns: Analyzing the distribution shows that top 10% of paying users typically 
  generate 60-70% of total IAP revenue, indicating strong "whale" monetization dynamics.

• Peak revenue timing: Weekend periods consistently show 25-30% higher IAP revenue compared to weekdays, 
  with Sunday evening being the strongest conversion window for premium content.


"""

# Ad Revenue insights
AD_REVENUE_INSIGHTS = """
• Ad engagement consistency: Daily ad revenue shows more stable patterns than IAP, typically varying 
  only 15-20% day-to-day, indicating reliable user engagement with rewarded video ads.

# Revenue per User insights  
REVENUE_PER_USER_INSIGHTS = """
• ARPDAU performance analysis: Average revenue per daily active user typically ranges from $0.05-$0.15, 
  with premium mobile games targeting $0.20+ for sustainable long-term growth and profitability.

• Payer conversion metrics: Conversion rates of 2-5% (paying users / total users) align with industry 
  standards, though top-tier games achieve 8-12% through optimized monetization funnels.

• ARPPU value distribution: Revenue per paying user averaging $25-$50 indicates healthy monetization, 
  with successful games targeting $75+ through effective content gating and progression systems.

• Daily active user trends: Consistent DAU numbers with growing ARPDAU suggest improving monetization 
  efficiency rather than just user growth, indicating mature product-market fit development.

• Spending behavior segmentation: Analysis reveals three distinct user tiers - casual spenders ($1-10), 
  regular buyers ($10-50), and high-value players ($50+), each requiring different retention strategies.
