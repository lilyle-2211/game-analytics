• The data shows a consistent trend of higher player acquisition on Mondays across all weeks.

# Demographics insights
DEMOGRAPHICS_INSIGHTS = """
Platform: 1. The data shows that Android has a higher number of players (13,164) compared to iOS (8,227), with a percentage distribution of 61.54% and 38.46% respectively. 2. The platform distribution pattern indicates that a majority of US players prefer Android devices for gaming, possibly due to a larger variety of affordable options available, while iOS users make up a significant but smaller portion of the player base.

Gender: 1. The gender distribution among US players is fairly balanced, with males making up 48.3% and females making up 47.67% of the total player base. 2. The relatively equal distribution of male and female players suggests a diverse and inclusive player base, with both genders actively participating in gaming activities. The presence of an unknown gender category at 4.03% indicates a need for more comprehensive data collection methods.

Channel Type: 1. The majority of US players (85.9%) were acquired through organic channels, with 18,375 players coming from this source. Marketing channels accounted for 14.1% of players, with 3,016 players acquired through these channels. 2. The high percentage of players acquired through organic channels suggests that the game has strong word-of-mouth or viral marketing potential, indicating a loyal player base that is likely to engage with the game for an extended period.

Age Groups: 1. The age group <=30 has the highest number of players with 29.12% (6228 players), followed closely by the age group 41-50 at 22.9% (4899 players). This indicates a significant portion of the player base is relatively young.

The distribution pattern shows a fairly even spread across different age groups, with a slight skew towards younger players. This suggests a diverse player base in terms of age, catering to a wide range of demographics.
